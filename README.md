1. **List Component (List.js):**
   - Previously, the `List` component only displayed posts and had logic to determine whether a post is saved or not (`isPostSaved` function).
   - Added functionality to handle click events on the "save" and "delete" icons:
     - If a post is not saved, clicking the "save" icon triggers the `savePost` function from the context, saving the post.
     - If a post is already saved, clicking the "delete" icon triggers the `unsavePost` function from the context, removing the post from the saved list.
   - Added an `onClick` event listener to the "delete" icon, which calls the `unsavePost` function with the post ID.

2. **PostContextProvider Component (postContext.js):**
   - Added a new function `unsavePost` to the `PostContextProvider` component. This function filters out the post with the provided ID from the `savedPosts` array and updates the state.
   - Exposed the `unsavePost` function in the context value along with other functions (`savedPosts`, `setSavedPosts`, `resetPosts`, `savePost`) so that it can be used in consuming components.

3. **App Component (App.js):**
   - No changes were made in the `App` component. It remains the entry point of the application, wrapping the entire app with the `PostContextProvider`.

The reason I provided the code directly is to ensure clarity and accuracy in implementing the required functionality. By providing the code directly, you can see precisely where and how the changes are made in each component. Additionally, I made sure to explain the purpose of each change to help you understand the modifications effectively. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification on any part, feel free to ask!
